Postman Mock Server URL : https://b1fd5849-2e3b-4b86-8bb7-27dcbfaf5220.mock.pstmn.io/

- Postman is not just REST API testing tool but is a complete collabaration tool for api development
  Hence Postman has features to support whole lifecycle of API development
  eg: API designing, Documentation, Monitoring, Testing, Automation testing etc
  
a. Design and Defining API: Using postman we can designa dn define contract of API
  request,response,headers etc can be defined in postman before development starts
  using tools like swagger is integrated with postman
b. collabaration of APIs: dev ,qa can share postman collections
c. Testing APIs using scripts + manual
d. documentation using swagger + its own format
e. Mocking the API to provide sample response
   Using this we can send mock response to client,
  so that client and server can do the development in parallel
f. monitor the APIs: using features it can monitor the Server APIs in scheduled basis
  and even in health check fail can send alerts

- Desktop Postman app can be used without signing in , but web app requires signing in
- Difference b/w Desktop and webapp version of postman
a. Desktop version do not require sign in but web app version requires sign in mandatorily
b. Since Desktop app is running locally you will not encounter CORS errors/features
  So web app will be running on different machine and hence CORS features will come into play
c. Private APIs can not be accessed via web app version, only public APIs can be accessed via webapp version  
   in summary if we want to test APIs over public then web or desktop app both works
  but in case the API to be tested in hosted locally or in a private network
  webapp version can not access these and hence desktop apps are preferred for these  

- If you are logged in the postman app it will sync the data to the cloud
  so in case you want to hide the working set and data do not log in
  also do not login in the office laptop/machine so that data is secured or push to private cloud
  better is to not login for office use and export workspace/collections and share to team members offline for collabaration

- In Postman if we choose authentication option as inherit from parent in the dropdown
  then it takes the authentication from parent folder
  this way we can have authentication rule at one place(typically in folder)
  and this same rule is applied to all the requests in that folder
  also in any of the children request/folder we can override this rule
  eg: we need basic auth for 3 request and for one request i need bearer token
  so keep basic auth in root folder , keep inherit from parent in 3 request
  and override ande put bearer token option in single request
  
- We can use path variables using ':varname', in param section can update it , might event use script code to populate this field
  eg: we have one api to create order, it returns orderid in response
  so in post script take this orderid and save in variables
  in second GET request we can use ':orderID' L with value as {{orderID}} and dynamically this value will be populated
- Another cool feature is bulk edit, in single shot we can create n variables and it shows up in url
- Postman also provide setting to url encode automactically
  eg url is : http://api.com?name=kanishk bhatt
  here we can have special charachter liek space , so postman provide this setting to url encode automactically
  we can turn this off as well  
  
- While choosing request body we have below options
a. form-data: like html form data : username,password,email etc
b. x-www-form-urlencoded: same as form data but data is url encoded
c. raw: choose json,xml etc
d. binary: for files images etc
e. graphql  

- header preset: in case we have multiple header key value pairs to be used across multiple requests in postman
  one way will be to create these one by one in all these requests
  better is to use header preset: create a header preset with n key value headers
  and use this in all these multiple requests
  
- Postman help in generating code snippet for client side for huge range of programming langauges and frameworks

- Types of variables in postman
a. Global variables: usable across all the collections in the workspace but value is not switchable based on environment
b. environment variables : usable across all the collections in the workspace but value is switchable based on environment
c. collection variables : usable only in that collection with no switching of values

- Remember that any variable can not be accessed outside the workspace
  if you want we can share the variable to another workspace and have a copy
  but any variable will be used only within the workspace
  
- using workspace we can group apis, monitors, collections etc into single group
  and share it collabaratively among multiple contributor
  we can assign multiple postman users to be able to view and contribute based on role defined  
- Each workspace have specific visibility
  personal: visible to only you and no one can view or contribute
  private: visible to limited set of users and have rbac for each user
  public: anyone can view and contribute
  team: team members can view
  in postman free account we can use personal workspace + restricted team mode+ public
  private is not available
  for private + complete team mode we need to pay

- postman provides a feature scratchpad where we can work in postman in offline
  meaning it do not send and sync the data to workspace cloud
  so in case there is no network or we do not want to share data to postman cloud scratchpad
  data only shared locally and not kept in cloud
  we can migrate scratchpad to workspace
  
- To launch the scratchpad we go to setttings and select scratchpad
  this opens a new window similar to workspace and says warning that data is not synched to cloud and swithc to workspace
  scratchpad is copy of workspace only thing is data is stored locally and wont be synhced to cloud  
  
- To migrate from scratchpad to workspace we must first export the scratchpad data into a file
  then go to workspace and import the same data file
  path: setting -> data -> export data
  go to workspace -> setting -> data -> import data from file generated in above step  
  Remember the above data export option exports all the data in taht workpaces
  meaning it exports settings, collections, mock server, monitors, environments everything inot json files
  lateron in another workspace we can import these files one by one
