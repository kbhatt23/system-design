Course API Github URL:
https://github.com/vdespa/quick-introduction-to-postman/blob/main/simple-tool-rental-api.md

- Postman is free for most use cases
- It comes in 3 flavors one is standalone app, another is browser web , chrome extension
  don not use chrome extension as it is obsolete
  
- Postman acts as GUI tool that supports api call over multiple protocols like http, graphql etc

- In setting variables we have 2 options one is initial value and another one is current value
  initial value is used to share over json export
  current value is actually used by postman
  so if some variable is sensitive like password we can keep dummy text like "your password" in initial value
  and in current value we can give actual value of password
  while exporting and sharing postman collection only initial value is shared and current value is not
  so postman can sensitively use current value

- In Postman we can declare placeholder for path variable using :variablename
  and in path variable key value we can set this and dynamically postman will override this value before calling API
  eg: {{BASE_URL}}/tools/:toolid
  here toolid become path variable placeholder in postman
  
- Postman allows oob variables that can generate random names, random values etc
  these starts with $ eg: "customerName": "{{$randomFullName}}"

- We can run the collections at once using collection runner
  sequence can be maintained in the ui
  however there are functions like postman.nextRequest("request name")
  using this we can define next request to execute or set null if to end
  never keep this as request name of previous request otherwise it will go in never ending loop
  
- If we want to schedule the collection runner to execute automatically during specific time
  we can use monitor runner

- To execute the postman collections using CL we can use CLI tool newman
  but it needs node js by default as postman is built on js
 npm install -g newman
 newman --version  
 
- To make newman run the collection we can export the postman collection to json 
   this json can also be imported in another dev's postman
  but the same json an be used by newman to run the entire collection
  newman run postman-course1.postman_collection.json
  we can also use share collection feature that generates an online link
  using newman we can run this link collection as well
